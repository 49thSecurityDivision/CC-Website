            <h2>CarolinaCon Online 2021 is over!</h2>
            <p>We would like to thank this years speakers for their amazing talks, along with everyone who came out and
                participated in the CTF and watched the livestreams! The team has learned quite a lot this year, and
                hope you did too. We not only learned how to run a conference online, but also took on running an
                internet wide CTF.
            </p>
            <p>We hope to see you next year!</p>
