                <h4>Zero-day .NET and Nvidia GFE Vulnerabilities Explained</h4>
                <h5>Matt Batten</h5>
                <p>I discovered two logical vulnerabilities that allowed for Local Privilege Escalation (LPE). These
                    vulnerabilities are interesting and recent. I have reported both and have had them both acknowledged
                    by Microsoft and Nvidia. Walking through
                    the process of discovery and then the actual exploit is fun and will show everyone how installing
                    new software will open up systems to more vulnerabilities.</p>

                <p>Friends and family ask for assistance installing WiFi or configuring smart devices in the house. They are now asking for help 'fixing my situation.'I will discuss how the CarolinaCon community can apply InfoSec, DFIR, and Insider Threat
                    principles to assist domestic abuse victims cutting the electronic cord to their abuser.</p>

                <h4>"<em>Ahem</em> Your IPv6 is showing..."</h4>
                <h5>Rumham</h5>
                <p>IPv6 is often seen as a mystical protocol by many folks and its scary to think about making the
                    transition from IPv4. What's even scarier is it's likely already in place within your organization
                    and attackers can leverage it against you!
                    Further, companies are quickly rolling out IPv6 within their public assets in an unsafe manner.
                    Let's focus on how Pentesters and adversaries are getting Domain Admin on your network, as well as
                    making sure you're covering all your
                    bases when dealing with IPv6.</p>

                <h4>Hack in Your Sleep</h4>
                <h5>David Hunt</h5>
                <p>When you wake up, do you brush your teeth or pour a cup of coffee? If real world decisions could be
                    laid out on a decision tree, you could identify trends. Now imagine you're a hacker. You were just
                    dropped into a computer network. Do
                    you start running discovery tactics or exfiltration? In this talk, I will break down how attackers
                    chain together benign actions to form a malicious attack. Then we'll apply this mindset and leverage
                    autonomous red teaming to compromise
                    a system in seconds.</p>

                <h4>Fuzzing by First Principles</h4>
                <h5>Takko_The_Boss</h5>
                <p>It's easy to get swept away in the litany of specified frameworks to follow. This habit of finding
                    similar enough schemas and tweaking them to make it work is unsustainable long-term. By reasoning
                    from first principles we can create holistic
                    fuzzing groundwork tailored to the device under test that produces the most relevant results that
                    are repeatable. This presentation explores standard & edge-cases of fuzz testing, and compares
                    methods for each.</p>

                <h4>Catching the CAN Bus: Car Hacking on a Budget</h4>
                <h5>Rachel Velasco</h5>
                <p>As cars become smarter, their attack surface grows. What exactly can you (and others) do to your own
                    car? This talk will cover core concepts in car hacking: in-vehicle networks, electronic control
                    units (ECUs), and how to manipulate them.
                    We will also go over recent breakthroughs in automotive security and starting your own research
                    workbench on the cheap.

                <h4>Practical Infrastructure Automation For Red Teams</h4>
                <h5>Cedric Owens</h5>
                <p>While red teams in their entirety cannot be automated, automation can surely help red teams in
                    several different ways. In this talk I will show some examples of how I have leveraged automation on
                    a small red team in order to help with
                    infrastructure standup. I will also share some code samples from my automation projects that others
                    can use and build upon.</p>

                <h4>Host-Based Detection, Forensics, and Response with Velociraptor</h4>
                <h5>Wes Lambert</h5>
                <p>Host-based detection, forensics, and response -- all of these features are available in a free and
                    open-source tool called Velociraptor. In this presentation, we'll cover how security teams can
                    leverage the power of Velociraptor and VQL
                    (Velociraptor Query Language) to unearth host artifacts, easily search across thousands of endpoints
                    for indicators, perform active response, associate findings to other datasets, and increase overall
                    endpoint visibility.</p>

                <h4>DNS tunneling down the rabbit hole</h4>
                <h5>Tim Steiner</h5>
                <p>So you're saying that I just spent 50K on a SIEM for my enterprise network and you were still able to
                    maintain C2 and exfiltrate data over DNS without detection? The words echoed menacingly in the dim
                    conference room. The client's hardened
                    expression was clearly visible. Before the consultant could respond, the client continued. How is
                    that possible? Our firewall blocks all outgoing DNS and we only permit DNS to our own internal
                    server. The consultant carefully crafted
                    his words as he explained.

                <h4>Hacking Humans: Using OSINT to put together Social Engineering Scenarios that Always Work</h4>
                <h5>Williams Price</h5>
                <p>In this talk, we teach how to use the internet and freely available information to craft perfect
                    social engineering attacks. We have used these very tactics to compromise employees as high-level as
                    corporate VPs with 2FA in place! After
                    showing how to create these social engineering scenarios and dupe victims, we show how security
                    professionals can train their clients to beware of the data they leave so that they are aware of
                    attackers intents.</p>

                <h4>Crash Course on Web Application Penetration Testing - Thinking Outside the OWASP 10</h4>
                <h5>JR Johnson</h5>
                <p>Many conference talks that address web application security or penetration testing focus on the OWASP
                    Top 10 to frame the discussion, but that's not realistic! In this talk, the focus is on a realistic
                    approach and walkthrough of web application
                    penetration testing, aimed at the red team interested in or doing these kinds of assessments and the
                    blue team/developers that need to better defend applications.
