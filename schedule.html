                      <p>In this intense keynote, Joshua brings the audience along for the ride on one of the most advanced social engineering attacks he's ever executed - robbing a bank over the phone. Audiences will be on the edge of their seats as they listen to real audio of Joshua convincing the Vice President of a bank to give up full access to his computer and eventually the entire facility. 
                        <br>Joshua will discuss why punitive approaches to cyber security awareness are counter-productive, how organizations can leverage AI tools to emphasize positive reinforcement techniques, and how data analysis and behavior analytics can be used to detect anomalies and create an engaging environment.</p>

                      <p> This talk is about my research related to software defined networking and dynamic network management. This talk will cover an overview of this research field and the current project I am working that allows for dynamically packet filtering on network switches. This solution provides a low cost distributed firewall solution that is able to scale with growing network demands.
                        <br>Our research focuses on automating local and global rules in a distributed firewall network while leveraging the benefits of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and SMT solvers. This allows use to integrate our system into IDS systems like snort and filter alerts without degrading the network state and introducing network loops. The end results of this research will be an open source way to develop and deploy the next generation of security appliances.
