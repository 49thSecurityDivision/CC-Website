      <h2> About </h2>
      <br>
      <p>  CarolinaCon was started in 2005 and has been held every year since. With each passing year the conference continues to grow and attract more attendees and speakers. As has always been the case, CarolinaCon is put together and run by an all-volunteer staff. This year, CarolinaCon is proudly brought to you by "The CarolinaCon Group", and 49th Security Division. </p>
