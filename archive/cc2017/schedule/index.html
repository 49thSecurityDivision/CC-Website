<span class="cmd-output welcome" id="Stephens-Phishing" style="display:none">
<p>The consistent and critical weakness in all cyber systems is the human. So much of cyber security focuses on "Technology" social engineering (phishing, whaling, etc). Yet these "technology" social engineering techniques are such a small possibility over the full social engineering realm at an attackers finger tips.</p>
<p>In this talk we will walk and talk the audience through 5 very simple, easy but profound social engineering skills that can be used to enhance "technology" social engineering, as well as move the offsec professional to more direct human-to-human attack vectors. For each technique I will provide real life stories of how effectively I have used them as I walk the audience through using them.</p>

<p>In many cases, building access badges have gone the way of "keep it secret; keep it safe", similar to how physical locks were shrouded for many years. Just as with physical locks, this does nothing to effectively control risk for an organization. </p>
<p>For the suits - In order to perform proper tests of design and effectiveness (i.e. a risk assessment), the technologies in use must be understood if an accurate threat model is to be created.</p>
<p>For the breakers - This talk will provide an overview of existing tech and attack methods that have proven to be highly-effective in good, old-fashioned B&E of an environment using RFID-based authentication entry controls.</p>
<p>Including demonstrations for both design flaws and compromise models, this talk will explore the technologies behind RFID-based access, common implementation issues, and methods to clone and/or replay virtually all RFID cards in current use to gain unauthorized access to a badge-controlled facility.</p>

<span class="cmd-output welcome" id="ybal_III-APentest" style="display:none">
<p>Since coming into popular use in the late 1960s, industrial control systems (ICS) have become prevalent throughout all areas of industry and modern life. Whether in HVAC systems, elevators, power grids, water treatment plants, traffic lights, gas pipelines, manufacturing robots or any of the myriad other applications, industrial control systems govern much of our lives.</p>
<p>This presentation will cover the basics of what an ICS/SCADA system is, a brief history of the technologies involved (and their security issues), a look at typical network protocols and network architectures used in ICS/SCADA systems, a glance at a typical (pentesting/red team) engagement and various attack strategies for succeeding as a pentester of industrial control systems.</p>

<p>Capture The Flag competitions present a unique opportunity to practice various information security problems and topics. Staying current with diverse tools and techniques is especially important for members of the InfoSec community. Some of the challenges presented in CTFs are web exploitation, forensics, cryptography, and binary exploitation/reversing. Despite the learning opportunities and fun experiences offered by CTFs, many are reluctant to try them. In this talk, our goal is to provide everything a person would need to start working on CTFs; we'll cover the various types of CTFs, possible challenges one might encounter, useful resources, and specific competitions worth checking out.</p>

When visiting homes of others, or when guests are gracious enough to come to our home, it's a pleasure to demonstrate just how easily one can prepare gourmet-grade feasts on a budget. But what if you're not in your house, or the abode of an accommodating friend with a nice kitchen? Many of us spend much of our work life on the road, struggling to eat healthy and well while staying within budget. Well, forget the hotel lobby restaurant. Don't Uber to the nearest Morton's. Hell, don't even put on your pants. In this talk we will snub our noses at room service and not take our our credit card save for one quick visit to a local grocery store. </p><p>The Hotel Room Gourmet will be a full and complete breakdown of a dizzying array of high-class food that we often make right in our hotel rooms (no suite or kitchenette needed!) which is healthier, tastier, and cheaper than nearly all other offerings available. Stick it to the man (and make your expense report happy) as you dine on deviled eggs, savory vegetables, and the thickest, juiciest rare steaks imaginable... all with perfect companion cocktails. Those who are present will not only learn but be afforded the opportunity to taste some of these exact creations! </p><p>Those who are vegan, forswear alcohol, or prefer their meat well-done are excused from attending.</p>

<p>In 1981 the French Directorate of Territorial Security (DST) flipped the high ranking KGB agent Colonel Vladimir who provided invaluable intelligence such a list of Soviet agents operating within the United States borders along with their intelligence targets. Control software for gas pipelines was found to be on the list and as a result the CIA set out to leak a tampered version of the software to one of the newly discovered agents. Then in 1982 the software, which was deployed on a Trans-Siberian gas pipeline, triggered a colossal explosion and "was the most monumental non-nuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space".

<span class="cmd-output welcome" id="ipMaddux-HoneyPy" style="display:none">
<p>This talk will provide a light intro to honeypots and their benefits, and highlight two projects HoneyPy and HoneyDB. Operating honeypot sensors on your internal network is a simple way to make your network "noisy" and can trip up malicious actors that have already penetrated your network. Also, leveraging data from honeypot sensors on the Internet can be a useful source of threat information. Are you leveraging honeypots in your organization? If not, why not? Adoption of these tools is likely about having simple easy to use interfaces and integrations into existing tools used by an organization.</p>
<p>HoneyPy is a low interaction honeypot with the capability to be more of a medium interaction honeypot. HoneyPy is written in Python and is intended to be easy to: deploy, extend functionality with plugins, and apply custom configurations. The level of interaction is determined by the functionality of its plugins. Plugins can be created to emulate UDP or TCP based services. All activity is logged to a file by default, but posting honeypot activity to Twitter, a Slack channel, or a web service endpoint can be configured as well. HoneyPy is ideal as a production honeypot on an internal network or as a research honeypot on the Internet.</p>
<p>HoneyDB is a web site dedicated to publishing honeypot data from HoneyPy sensors on the Internet. It also offers honeypot data for download via a REST API. Web site users can also log into HoneyDB and maintain a ThreatBin, which is custom list of honeypot session data bookmarked by the user. Future features include consolidated threat information from other honeypot Twitter accounts, and expanding the API.</p>
