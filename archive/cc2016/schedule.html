Perimeter recon is a constantly changing environment, as companies grow
and flex there are constantly new targets introduced to the landscape.
Finding these for penetration testing is important, but more important
for Red Team emulating persistent attackers.<br/>

the perimeter from an OSINT perspective, using tools to rapidly assess

<div class="abstract">
<span>ABSTRACT</span>
<p>
The FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver (FLOSS) is an open source tool that automatically
detects, extracts, and decodes obfuscated strings in Windows Portable Executable (PE) files.
Malware analysts, forensic investigators, and incident responders can use FLOSS to quickly
extract sensitive strings to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs).<br/>
Malware authors encode strings in their programs to hide malicious activity and impede reverse
engineering. Even simple encoding schemes defeat the strings tool and complicate static and
dynamic analysis. Reverse engineers are challenged to decode the obfuscated data in order to
fully understand a program. This usually involves recognizing encoded strings, re-implementing
the decoding function, and manually applying the algorithm to the data. This process may take
several hours for each malware variant. FLOSS automates this down to seconds without
requiring the analyst to examine the deobfuscation method.<br/>
Although FLOSS uses advanced static analysis techniques such as emulation, the tool can be
used by anyone. Incident responders and forensic analysts that understand how to interpret
the strings found in a binary will understand FLOSS’s output. FLOSS extracts higher value
strings, as strings that are obfuscated typically contain the most sensitive configuration
resources – including malicious domains, IP addresses, suspicious file paths, and other IOCs.

change depending on any feedback I receive.<br/>
Talk will discuss the current state of the framework, how to use the
framework and work flow in your OSINT investigations. Will follow that
with future plans for the framework, how the community can help if they

<span>ABSTRACT</span>
<p>
Criminals use Vishing to trick victims in order to commit fraud or for other
nefarious purposes. In this presentation we’ll will cover a bit of
background, the current state of Vishing attacks along with how
fraudsters use these tactics for their benefit.<br/>
Vishing is often overlooked vector and as a result of CarolinaCon 2016,
I wrote PhreakMe; an open source tool that lowers the bar for security
professionals to add the Vishing vector to their toolkit. Using this
I’ll demonstrate how penetration testers can use open source software
to utilize vishing tactics in their tests and how organizations can
use this to their benefit.<br/>
There is only one phishing vendor I am aware of that claims to provide
"vishing" services, and PhreakMe is a little different. Mainly because
it is OSS and can be adapted and developed depending on the
communities needs.

The ArmaLite pattern rifle, specifically the AR-15, is arguably
America's most popular long arm. Villainized in the press, issued by

countless US homes... the famous ""black rifle"" is one of the most
extensible and configurable firearms, yet so many users do little
beyond attaching a new optic or other accessory on their picattiny
rail.<br/>
This talk will be an exploration of how many features and modifications
are possible on AR rifles. Deviant will showcase his custom AR-15 which
can function as upwards of five very distinct firearms. Yes, five.
One single gun (the lower receiver is the only serialized and
controlled element, regulated by the ATF) can shoot a variety of
calibers of ammunition, launch exotic projectiles, and serve in a
great many roles: from defense to plinking to weekend craziness
and more.<br/>
If you can only own one gun... why not opt to make it one that easily
converts to multiple guns?

In the presentation that threat intel vendors do not want you to see,

Reporting for Hackers is the vim-loving, terminal cowboy wannabee’s,

Basically your redneck name. Take the first syllable of your last name

with a "Bobby". That’s your Bobby name. [Jo]n [Mo]lesa becomes
