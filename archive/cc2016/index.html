<h2>BADGE</h2>
<p>This yearâ€™s badge will be an easy to assemble electronic kit. The small kit
will be included with the price of admission, and will contain some basic
components (even batteries!). Feel free (and encouraged!) to bring additional
parts to solder in and hack together. We will be selling Arduino Micro boards
(chinese clones) with male and female headers on them. The badge itself will
have a large enough protoboard area to fit an Arduino Micro or Arduino Nano
compatible board. A boost converter will be included with the Arduino Micros
to allow them to be powered from the two AAA batteries that come with the
badge kit. The Micro compatible board and the boost convertor will be provided
as rewards for a $20 donation. A partial schematic with the important bits is

<h2>SIDE EVENTS</h2>
<h3>Capture the Flag - Friday Night until Sunday at NOON</h3>
<p>"CTF, is a traditional outdoor game where two teams each have a flag (or other marker) and the object is to..."</p>
<p>We kid; we do, we do! Seriously, as a staple CTF needs no introduction. But for any newer folks out there: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security" target="_blank">CTF</a> (note the apparent requisite white t-shirts and glasses)
<p>The CTF this year will be a scenario based event where contestants will assist a fictitious company secure their borders by finding and reporting as many vulnerabilities (find and submit as many flags) as possible before the event ends.</p>
<h3>Crypto Challenge - Friday 12pm - Saturday 5pm (subject to change)</h3>
<p>@lintile is back again this year to bring us another great crypto challenge. I know many attendees had fun working on this one in groups in the CTF room. This is a favorite not to be missed. The challenges start easy and are a great way to learn about different types of encryption. There are always folks around who are happy to help newbies.</p>
<h3>Windows Kernel Primer - Training - Sunday @ 1PM (2 Hours)</h3>
<p><strong>Space will be limited, please RSVP.</strong> We are planning on running the class Sunday from 1pm to 3pm.</p>
<p>Understanding the Windows kernel has typically been considered a steep learning curve and not for the faint of heart. However, many vulnerabilities have surfaced from the depths of the kernel over the years proving it a lucrative target for attackers. This course is geared toward providing a deeper understanding of how user applications interact with kernel device drivers and the related security implications. We will roll up our sleeves in some hands on exercises as we break down the different software components. </p>
<p>To register send an email to debug[at]thexrg[dot]com with the "Carolinacon Training" in the subject line.</p>
<h3>Hardware Village</h3>
<p>More information coming soon!</p>
<p>If you happen to have some temperature controllable solder stations you feel like loaning us for the duration of the conference, please reach out to speakers&lt;at&gt;carolinacon.org.
<h3>Lockpicking Village</h3>
<p>CarolinaCon's Lock-Picking Village (organized by FALE and Oak City Locksport)
will be open Friday, March 4th, from registration until Sunday March 6th when we get tired of dealing with it.
Be sure to come by for shenanigans, contests, drinks, foam cannons, hot chicks, beat poetry, learning, and pool noodles.
At least one of the aforementioned features will occur.</p>
<p>Lock-picking Rules:</p>
<p>Only pick the test locks provided in the breakout room(s). Do not go around
trying to pick hotel locks, locks of cars in the parking lot, etc. during
CarolinaCon. Violators of this rule will be swiftly kicked out of the
conference and the hotel, and possibly arrested.</p>
<p>Do not pocket/steal any picks, pick sets, test locks, etc. Violators of this
rule will have their f'ing hands cut off, and then we'll kick them out of the
hotel and ban them from all future conference attendance.</p>
 
<h3>Unofficial CC Shootout - Friday: 12pm - 5pm</h3>
<p>Now in its 8th year, the Annual, Unofficial CarolinaCon Shootout is once again a go! Click <a href="http://hackers.withguns.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a> to visit the official page and get all the details!</p>

<a name="FAQ"></a>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Who develops and delivers CarolinaCon?</h3>
<p>CarolinaCon is proudly brought to you by "The CarolinaCon Group". The CarolinaCon
Group is a non-profit organization registered in the state of NC, dedicated
to educating the local and global communities about technology,
information/network/computer security, and information rights. The CarolinaCon
Group is also closely associated with various "2600" chapters across NC, SC,
TN, VA, LA, DC, and NY. Many of the volunteers who help develop and deliver
CarolinaCon come from those chapters.</p>
<h3>What events will be at CarolinaCon?</h3>
<p>CarolinaCon is mainly about the educational talks, presentations, and demos.
Alongside those we will have several other technology-related contests and
challenges. Details on other events will be announced on our website as they are
planned out.</p>
<h3>Can my company sponsor CarolinaCon?</h3>
<p>We don't accept any, so don't bother asking. Capitalism and philanthropic
knowledge-sharing don't mix in our opinion. We keep our admission price to the
bare minimum to cover our venue and equipment expenses. All of our staff are
volunteers who generously donate their time and energy. All of our presenters
generously donate their time and talent. The only items sold at CarolinaCon
are a limited quantity of single-design CarolinaCon t-shirts....and we only
make and sell those because attendees and staff want them.</p>
<h3>What about donating to CarolinaCon?</h3>
<p>Well that's a different story. We will gladly accept donations from anyone
who wants to contribute. At CarolinaCon, we pride ourselves on not charging
a lot for admission so we don't have a lot to spend on giveaways (we manage
though). We can always use prizes for Hacker Trivia and various other
contests that we run so if you want to donate an actual prize, rather than
cash, just let us know by sending an email to: info&lt;at&gt;carolinacon.org</p>
<p>We'll also take cash. :-)</p>
