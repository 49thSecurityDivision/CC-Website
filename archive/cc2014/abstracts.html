Welcome  to a world where getting a hash should mean you also just owned

 more interesting when it's a bank. &nbsp;This talk will discuss the  basic
concepts behind password hashes, how they can be obtained, and  what to do

 Geek/Introvert - Luke (MindNinja) Stephens</b><br>
<br>
The human in the equation is always the weakest security link. Metasploit, nmap, 
Burp and such tools do nothing for the security professional in hacking the human
 factor. Social engineering techniques and skills, alone, provide the powerful mechanism 
for cracking the human element. While many security professionals conduct "anonymous" 
social engineering attacks (phishing schemes and such) most have been led to believe 
that do do non-anonymous social engineering one must be a charismatic mythical man.

do good "in person" social engineering and open up new doors to assessments.<br>

and Lemons - Tom Holt / Professor Farnsworth</b><br>
<br>
Mass data  breaches have grabbed media attention over the last decade, ranging
from  the TJX breach in 2007 to the most recent compromise of Target and
 Neiman Marcus.  The academic research community from both the social and 
 technical sciences are increasingly focused on the activities of data  thieves
and the market for data resale that has emerged in forums and  IRC.  These
studies have varying depth of content and  representativeness, creating a
great deal of speculation about the  profit margins and economy for stolen
data. In fact, Herley and Florencio argue that open forums for  stolen data
are largely "lemon markets" in that the data sold is invalid  or will lead
a buyer to be ripped off rather than receive product. Any  cost estimates
derived from such an analysis are likely to be invalid  and reflect the practices
of unscrupulous vendors rather than  demonstrate the activities of sophisticated
and "legitimate markets."   This presentation will explore whether lemon
markets exist, using  qualitative and quantitative analyses of a sample of
threads from 13  Russian and English language forums involved in the sale
of stolen data.   Estimates for the prices for data sold in the markets will
be  provided, along with an examination of the social and market forces that 
 shape the advertised prices for certain products. The policy  implications
of this study for consumers, law enforcement, and security  analysts will
be discussed in depth to provide improved mechanisms for  the disruption
and takedown of stolen data markets globally. <br>

<b>AV Evasion with the Veil Framework -  HarmJ0y, Christopher Truncer, and
Michael Wright</b><br>
<br>
As antivirus (finally) has started to slowly increase in  effectiveness,
more and more of the payloads used during penetration  tests are being caught.
While the industry as a whole has demonstrated  its capabilities of bypassing
AV solutions in nearly all situations,  valuable assessment time is often
lost.  The Veil&shy;-Evasion Framework was  developed to solve this problem
by offering a modular, open &shy;source,  and UI focused framework for generating
AV&shy;-evading payloads in a  programming language and technique agnostic
way. Veil's structure  greatly simplifies payload generation and allows for
the integration of  public and private AV evasion methods. In this talk we
will go over the  genesis of the framework, its structure and features, and
how to develop  your own payload modules. Recently released modules will
also be  covered, and our implementation of a lesser known shellcode injection
 method will be covered.<br>
<br>
We will also cover public reaction and  disclosure ethics, and we plan on
discussing Veil&shy;-Catapult, our payload  delivery tool. Veil&shy;-Catapult
extends the capabilities of the existing  Veil framework by utilizing various
methods to deliver and trigger  payloads across targeted machines. We will
conclude with a discussion of  current and future mitigation strategies to
combat Veil&#8217;s  effectiveness.<br>

<b>Hack Android using Normal Permissions &amp; Broadcast Receivers - Fadi
Mohsen</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;In this work, we investigate the risks of  permissions of normal protection
level when used in broadcast receivers.  Android broadcast receivers allow
applications to register to listen to  System events (e.g. receive call,
receive message). <br>
We first  conduct an extensive study on the evolution of Android broadcast
actions  over all releases. We study their overhead and permissions  requirements.
We then study the implications of including broadcast  receivers in third
party applications: battery life and user&#8217;s privacy.  Finally, we implement
a malicious Android application in an effort to  compromise user&#8217;s privacy.
The study finds that the numbers of  broadcast&#8217;s actions have increased by
64% since Android first release.   We also find that user&#8217;s privacy can be
compromised using broadcast  receivers that require normal permissions. Moreover,
uncontrolled  broadcast receivers&#8217; registration can drain device battery
which can be  frustrating. Existing security and privacy tools have to consider
new  attack types and techniques.<br>

<b>Reverse Engineering Executables - John F. Davis (Math for 400)</b><br>

An  introduction to reverse engineering application executables to  determine

 from source is constructed into intel assembly, then it  shows how to examine
the assembly to identify common components.   Afterwards the audience can
see that examining large programs with this  method is complex and time consuming.<br>
The next topic is how to  proceed using the industry term static analysis
to identify key  functional constructs.  The executable usage of libraries
to perform  tasks are used to anticipate function.  <br>
Lastly the industry term  dynamic analysis is used to show how an executable
can be run in a  virtual machine environment to safely examine an executable
at runtime. &nbsp;These techniques can help you understand how a program
behaves and determine if the program is safe to run.<br>

<b>Bypassing EMET 4.1 - Jared  DeMott</b><br>
<br>
The goal of the research to be presented was  to gauge the difficultly of
bypassing the protections offered by EMET, a  popular Microsoft zero-day
prevention capability.  We initially focused  on just the ROP protections,
but later expanded to all the protections  in the real world study.  We were
able to bypass EMET&#8217;s protections in  example code and via a real world browser
exploit.  The two primary  novel elements in our research are:<br>
1)	Deep study regarding the ROP protections, using example applications<br>
2) 	Detailed and novel code showing how to defeat the stack pivot  protection
(SPP), using a real world example.  Included in the SPP  bypass is an EAF
bypass for Windows 7.<br>

The impact of this study shows  that technologies that operate on the same
plane of execution as  potentially malicious code, offer little lasting protection.<br>

a  buzzword and if you didn't then you can hand in your hacker card now.
  This talk will move beyond the buzzwords in an effort to demystify the
 world of hyperscale computing.  Like it or not, you use Google and  Amazon's
services so wouldn't you like to know how they work?<br>
<br>
The  goal of this talk is to educate others in the community about how these 
 large scale cloud operations actually work.  It might make you trust  them
more or it might make you trust them less but at least you'll be  more educated.
 The talk will be a high level talk focusing on  terminology, infrastructure,
security implications, general concepts,  and more.  Beer will be drunk and
examples will be given.  The talk will  also go into the future (with a crystal
ball though, not a time  machine) and how these operators are impacting smaller
companies that  might not use cloud services today.<br>

 	The security profession, the REAL security profession, is a difficult road 
to traverse. There are things you need to know that can make or break you. I am 
willing to show you what I did to go from IT administrator to Red Team pen tester.
Join me as I share real world experence on how to market yourself, get recognition 
for your work, and show you how to stand out in a crowded profession. After all, 
to stand out in a profession of cynics it will take WORK on your part.<br>
