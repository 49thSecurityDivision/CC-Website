<h3>FAQ</h3>
<br>
<h4>Who develops and delivers CarolinaCon?</h4>
<br>
<p>
CarolinaCon is proudly brought to you by "The CarolinaCon Group". The CarolinaCon Group is a non-profit organization registered in the state of NC, dedicated to educating the local and global communities about technology, information/network/computer security, and information rights. The CarolinaCon Group is also closely associated with various "2600" chapters across NC, SC, TN, VA, LA, DC, and NY. Many of the volunteers who help develop and deliver CarolinaCon come from those chapters.</p>
<h4>What is the cost of admission for CarolinaCon?</h4><br>
<p>To make it easier on ourselves we only sell tickets at the door for <strong>$40 cash</strong>. <strong>No checks or cards.</strong> We will provide you with a ticket stub that can be used for CPE credits. We won’t run out of seats so don’t be concerned about not being able to pre-register. Doors will open at 5pm on Friday.
</p>
<h4>What events will be at CarolinaCon? </h4><br>
<p>
CarolinaCon is mainly about the educational talks, presentations, and demos. Alongside those we will have several other technology-related contests and challenges (lockpick village and a CTF). Details on other events will be announced on our website as they are planned out.</p>
<h4>Can my company sponsor CarolinaCon? </h4>
<br>
<p>
We don't accept any, so don't bother asking. Capitalism and philanthropic knowledge-sharing don't mix in our opinion. We keep our admission price to the bare minimum to cover our venue and equipment expenses. All of our staff are volunteers who generously donate their time and energy. All of our presenters generously donate their time and talent. The only items sold at CarolinaCon are a limited quantity of single-design CarolinaCon t-shirts....and we only make and sell those because attendees and staff want them.</p>
<h4>What about donating to CarolinaCon? </h4><br>
<p>Well that's a different story. We will gladly accept donations from anyone who wants to contribute. At CarolinaCon, we pride ourselves on not charging a lot for admission so we don't have a lot to spend on giveaways (we manage though). We can always use prizes for Hacker Trivia and various other contests that we run so if you want to donate an actual prize, rather than cash, just let us know by sending an email to: info{at}carolinacon.org
We'll also take cash. :-)</p>
