<p>This year's Lock Pick Village at CarolinaCon 14 is once again going to be run by Oak City Locksport. We will be hosting walk-in beginners lessons, a picking competition, and Jeremy's "Box" challenge. No prior knowledge or tools are required, and all skill levels are welcome. OCL staff will be on hand to teach you or answer any questions you might have. We look forward to meeting you and sharing our love of locksport. A limited number of special edition CarolinaCon 14 lockpick sets will be available for sale at the Shirt table.</p>
<p><strong>"Connect Three"</strong> - Our picking competition is a take on the old "Connect Four" game you might have played, but with fewer spots. Instead of checkers we'll play with padlocks! You need to get three non-destructive "unlocks" in any direction to win the game while also trying to block your opponent. Competition will be open to "teams" of one to four people. Tools will be provided or you can use your own. This will be a tournament style competition with the full rules will be posted on site. Swing by the village Saturday to challenge others before competition starts and sign up!</p>
<p><strong>"The Box"</strong> - The Box is a physical security challenge inspired by the DEF CON Box challenge, and created by Jeremy Manos. The difference with this challenge is that the box is made of acryllic so you can see what you're up against. Does that help? Maybe a little. Can you beat it? Come try!</p>

<p>Interested in learning how to hack WiFi? The GHS Shoothouse for WiFi (GSW) is here! Pat Wylie & Shawn Brown (<a href="./cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a1e6d3c4c4cfc9e1d5">[email&#160;protected]</a> Solutions) will host a half day Wireless presentation and training event and provide a safe environment with several (IEEE 802.11) wireless scenarios for participants to train on.</p>
<p>Wireless scenarios will include: WEP 64-bit, WEP 128-bit, Clientless WEP, multiple WPA2 cracking scenarios- grabbing handshakes, attacking shitty passwords, building and using dictionaries, and more! All of these scenarios will be running simultaneously to allow maximum time for participants to train on. Presentations on how to navigate through each target will be given throughout the day.</p>

<strong><i>What do I need to bring to attack your targets?</i></strong>
</a>
</div>
<div id="wifi-details" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">
<ul>
<li>- Participants will need their own laptop. Regarding the OS and/or tools - recommend they have Kali, Pentoo, Parrot or whatever their preference is.</li><br>
<li>- Our demonstrations will be done via the aircrack-ng suite of tools - if participants use auto-crack tools (i.e. WiFite, Fern, Cain,etc.), they will be heckled but it's okay, they won't work for everything ðŸ˜ˆ</li><br>
<li>- They will also need to bring a wireless card that supports injection. My recommendation is the Alfa AWUS-051NH v.2 (Bronze-colored). Other Alfa cards are fine (silver, blue, orange, black) - however, most of these do not support 5GHz capability.
<ul>
<br>
<li>-- Prices vary depending on the vendor ($80+ on Amazon). My recommendation is <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIACUE5X66171">NewEgg (retails for ~$53)</a></li>
</ul>
</li><br>
<li>- Participants are recommended to bring their own VM. A copy of Kali will be available just in case.
</li><br>
<li>- For those that want to try and run internal WiFi NICs or test the one they've got - they can test the cards capabilities by doing the following:
<ul>
<li><br>
 <code>iw list | grep mode -A 8</code>
<br><br>
<p>Look for the word <strong>monitor</strong> in the output - this will ensure you have monitor mode capability</p>
<code>iw list | grep Frequencies -A 10 </code>
<br><br>
<p>Look for 2.4 and 5 Ghz to ensure you will be able to connect to all targets</p>
<p>Your output should look similar to the following examples (iw list commands)</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>What's Planned</strong>
<br>
<p>There's going to be one open access point that will host the web page that provides the Rules of Engagement and information required to engage the targets. </p>
<p>This same web page will have download links for two (locally stored) common password dictionaries that can be used to crack access points. </p>
<p>While cracking keys is cool, it doesn't stop there. Some of the targets will require additional knowledge that many either forget or don't know - demonstrations will be given on a non-range network throughout the day.</p>
<p>For those that do choose to participate, there will be a live scoring engine that will be on display. Participants will be able to register, and receive a unique token to ensure integrity upon submission. Once a participant submits a correct flag, the scoring engine will update the scoreboard and show live results of who's got what points.</p>

Threat Hunting with ELK (training workshop - four hours) - Saturday Afternoon
<p>This hands-on training will walk attendees through leveraging the open source ELK
stack to analyze logs to proactively identify malicious activity. The basic tools and
techniques taught during this class can be used to investigate isolated security
incidents or implemented at scale for continuous monitoring. Attendees will be
provided with access to a preconfigured ELK instance and extensive sample logs
containing diverse malicious events waiting to be discovered.
</p>
<p><strong>Attendees will need to bring their own laptop capable of running VMs copied over from USB flash drives and accessing WiFi internet. Seats will be limited. Sign Up information coming soon. Watch this space and @CarolinaCon.
