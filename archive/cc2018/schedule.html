<div id="packet-raquet" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">
<p>TLDR; Nifty Python tool to play music corresponding to network traffic that contains the potential for an accessibility function for the visually-impaired.</p>
<p>Originally conceived of as a cool idea to examine network traffic generated by penetration testing in lieu of reviewing tcpdump or Wireshark output, <a href="./cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1464546561716066">[email&#160;protected]</a>@quet turned into a valid means of creating music from network traffic patterns. Also, by creating a sound-based representation of network traffic, the utility provides insight into normal traffic patterns as opposed to oddities such as ICMP ping or UDP/TCP port scans. Anyone, whether an analyst or tester, interested in keeping track of the network can listen to the sounds of the packets instead of scrolling through Wireshark or tcpdump packets. </p>
<p>As an example, if a port scan was observed by the monitoring interface, those packets would correspond to different sounds, thereby yielding an aural experience matching that traffic pattern. Visually-impaired individuals could be trained as to the notes and corresponding packets and be empowered to conduct hitherto inaccessible network analysis. The project consists of a Python script to demonstrate both live traffic examples and previously recorded packet captures.</p>

<span class="badge">21:00</span> Writing FreeBSD Malware (by Shawn Webb)
</a>
</div>
<div id="freebsd-malware" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">
<p>Without exploit mitigations and with an insecure-by-default design, writing malware for FreeBSD is a fun task, taking us back to 1999-era Linux exploit authorship. Several members of FreeBSD's development team have claimed that Capsicum, a capabilities/sandboxing framework, prevents exploitation of applications. Our in-depth analysis of the topics below will show that in order to be effective, applying Capsicum to existing complex codebases lends itself to wrapper-style sandboxing. Wrapper-style sandbox is a technique whereby privileged operations get wrapped and passed to a segregated process, which performs the operation on behalf of the capsicumized process. With a new libhijack payload, we will demonstrate that wrapper-style sandboxing requires ASLR and CFI for effectiveness. FreeBSD supports neither ASLR nor CFI. Tying into the wrapper-style Capsicum defeat, we'll talk about advances being made with libhijack, a tool announced at Thotcon 0x4. The payload developed in the Capsicum discussion will be used with libhijack, thus making it easy to extend. We will also learn the Mandatory Access Control (MAC) framework in FreeBSD. The MAC framework places hooks into several key places in the kernel. We'll learn how to abuse the MAC framework for writing efficient rootkits. Attendees of this presentation should walk away with the knowledge to skillfully and artfully write offensive code targeting both the FreeBSD userland and the kernel.</p>

<p>This talk will discuss the benefits of data visualization when performing security analysis and also presenting analysis findings.

The security community need to take some direction from the infographic age and display data in way their clients can easily digest. During this talk I will talk about a variety of techniques one could use to help identify malicious patterns in data sets and how to present them by visualizing the data in graphs like:<br><br>Time Series / Timelines<br>Distributions <br>Correlation Plots<br>Ranking<br>Maps<br>Flow<br><br>These visualizations (if used correctly) can serve as a tool for information security analysts to detect and present findings that show the threat.</p>

<p>
Still trying to make sense of deserialization flaws and how they became a "thing"? Deserialization flaws can be very complex and require deep knowledge of the target programming language, so it is no surprise that most hackers don't understand much beyond use of payload tools (e.g. ysoserial). Unlike most talks on this subject, Jason will break down the jargon to explain which elements of Object Oriented Methodologies (OOM) have brought on a plethora of deserialization flaws in Java and other OO languages. This talk will be accompanied with simplified demos and sample code to help understand deserialization flaws and how corresponding attack payloads are made.

</a>
</div>
<div id="fast-neural-networks" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">
<p>Artificial Neural Networks are a fascinating computational approach modeled to react similar to a biological brain to solve problems. Neural networks are a very powerful tool that enable machines to teach and evolve themselves. You can utilize this power in almost any application. Don't be intimidated by the equations and Greek symbols of this cutting-edge technology, I will guide you on how to slay this technology and make it bend to your will!</p><p>In this session, we are going to demystify the presumed complexity of Neural Networks. No need for a PhD or mathematical background, after this overview, you will be discussing these concepts around the water cooler. There will be very little math and lots of coding. The goal is for everyone to become acquainted with Neural Network from a pragmatic standpoint. In this session, we will take a closer look at artificial neural networks inspired by biological neurons. We will study how these neurons can be modeled in a digital counterpart. After a short introduction of the actor model, the commonalities between neurons and how Actors work by building an asynchronous and reactive neural network will be demonstrated. </p><p>Just when you think it couldn't get any better, I will show you how to employ the functional paradigm to leverage multicore machines and GPUs to make your neural network predictions infinitely faster through parallelism. By the end of this talk, you will learn the basic concepts of Neural Network and how to apply functional concurrency to estimate future stock prices at smoking fast speeds…and perhaps get rich while practicing!</p>

<p>Tired of carrying heavy backpacks? Wondering why wireless assessments can be such a drag? Script kiddies making fun of you for your outdated tools and techniques? If so, then the WiFiPi is for you!<p>In this talk, I'll discuss using Raspberry Pis to assess wireless networks. Your Pi can be a valuable tool in pentesting, remote monitoring, managing networks, signal testing, and more.</p><p>If you're new to Raspberry Pis, this talk will give you general methodolgy for wireless assessments as well as tips for making your gear more portable. If you're not into wireless testing, then hopefully you'll come away with some other half-baked ideas for all of those Pis that we all have Pi-ling up!</p>

</a>
</div>
<div id="HideNSneak" class="accordion-body collapse">
<div class="accordion-inner">
<p>
HideNSneak evolved as a tool to expand evasive penetration testing capabilities. It allows users to rapidly
 deploy, manage, and quickly take down a distributed cloud attack infrastructure by leveraging features of
large Cloud Providers and their content delivery networks. Techniques include domain fronting with multiple
providers, distributed scanning, and source of attack obfuscation. Leaning on the reputation of these networks
allows traffic to more easily blend in to network traffic and create difficulty in blocking attack infrastructure.
Furthermore, the ephemeral nature of the tool itself provides a realistic threat simulation, which also simulates
the realistic headache this type of attack causes defenders, when they try to attribute actions to certain sets of hosts.</p>
<p>The overview of the toolsets features will contain an explanation of the tactics and techniques in order
to provide both red teamers and blue teamers alike with more insight into why this works in "modern" networks,
as well as real world scenarios. Finally, information will be provided to blue teamers in an effort to provide
knowledge that can be brought back and leveraged to increase security posture.</p>

Mike Hodges is a Senior Security Consultant for the Optiv Attack and Penetration Practice.
His current focus is on expanding evasive penetration testing methodologies while
similtaneously impostering as a developer. When is not wrist-deep in technical work
he is on the BJJ mats, hopefully not in an armbar.

<p>
Blockchain as a technology has been proposed as a solution to everything from frictionless currency transfer to tracking cargo on ships. With over one billion dollars in venture funds invested and several hundred patents filed, every security professional must know the impact on organizations in terms of risk, volatility, and competitiveness.</p>
<p>This talk will explore alternative uses for blockchain technology other than cryptocurrency, and provide a framework for utilizing and securing a technology considered as disruptive as the Internet was in the 1990s.
