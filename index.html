                Hey all, we hope everyone is excited for the next CarolinaCon!
                The team has spent time exploring our options, and decided to run the conference online this year. This means we delay what would be Carolina Con 16 another year*. The <a href="https://cfp.carolinacon.org/Carolinacon/">call for papers (CFP) is live</a>, and the official conference date will be in April (I'll update the exact date here and on twitter!). We will be hosting an internet open Capture the flag (CTF) again, and can't wait to show you the new challenges  we have in store!

                <br>
                *Hotels have risen their rates quite a bit this year, and we were not able to find another venue in CLT that would work for us. With the new COVID variants, we decided to play it safe and go online again this year.
