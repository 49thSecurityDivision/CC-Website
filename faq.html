            <h3>What events will be at CarolinaCon?</h3>

            <p>CarolinaCon is mainly about the educational talks, presentations, and demos. Alongside those we will have
            several other technology-related contests and challenges. Details on other events will be announced on our
            website as they are planned out. Since this year will be online, expect the con to operate differently.</p>
            
            <h3>Can my company sponsor CarolinaCon?</h3>

            <p>We don't accept any, so don't bother asking. Capitalism and philanthropic knowledge-sharing don't mix in our
            opinion. We keep our admission price to the bare minimum to cover our venue and equipment expenses. All of
            our staff are volunteers who generously donate their time and energy. All of our presenters generously
            donate their time and talent. The only items sold at CarolinaCon are a limited quantity of single-design
            CarolinaCon t-shirts....and we only make and sell those because attendees and staff want them.</p>
            
            <h3>What about donating to CarolinaCon?</h3>

            <p>Well that's a different story. We will gladly accept donations from anyone who wants to contribute. At
            CarolinaCon, we pride ourselves on not charging a lot for admission so we don't have a lot to spend on
            giveaways (we manage though). We can always use prizes for Hacker Trivia and various other contests that we
            run so if you want to donate an actual prize, rather than cash, just let us know by sending an email to:
            <i>info (at) carolinacon.org</i></p>
