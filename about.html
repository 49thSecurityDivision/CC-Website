            <p>CarolinaCon was started in 2005 and has been held every year since. With each passing year the conference continues to grow and attract more attendees and speakers. As has always been the case, CarolinaCon is put together and run by an all-volunteer
                staff. This year, CarolinaCon is proudly brought to you by "The CarolinaCon Group", and 49th Security Division.</p>
            <p>The CarolinaCon Group is dedicated to educating the local and global communities about technology, information/network/computer security, and information rights.</p>
            <p>The CarolinaCon Group is also closely associated with various 2600 chapters across NC, SC, TN, VA, LA, DC, GA, PA and NY. Many of the volunteers who help develop and deliver CarolinaCon come from those chapters.</p>
            <p>49th Security Division is a Student Organization based out of UNC Charlotte.</p>
